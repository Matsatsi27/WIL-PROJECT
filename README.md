# WIL-PROJECT
The Central Karoo is a semi-arid region in the Western Cape of South Africa, characterized by vast open spaces, mountainous terrain, and scattered population centers.
Our responsibility in the Central Karoo project is to design, construct, and maintain a network that provides improved internet access to homes, medical facilities, and government buildings throughout the district. We will install fast and dependable internet in roughly 3000 residences, three hospitals, and local government buildings.
